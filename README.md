# Hi there, I'm Skaikru_ 👋

I’m diving into the world of **fullstack development** from the ground up, with a strong start in frontend. 
Programming isn't just a career goal for me; it's also a passion and hobby.
I’m drawn to modern, minimalistic designs that look great and emphasize responsiveness for all screen sizes.

As an **open-minded** and **fast learner**, I'm constantly exploring new tools and techniques. My aim is to create intuitive, visually appealing web experiences. Let’s build something amazing together! 🚀
